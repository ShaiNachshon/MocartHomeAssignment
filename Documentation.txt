How to use:
Use A/D or ←/→ to move sideways (optional, for convenience).
Click the 'New Shop' button to fetch server data and instantiate a new shop with corresponding products.
Click the 'Update Shop' button to open a user-friendly interface, where you can modify product data and view feedback on your changes.
Click the 'Save Changes' button to save your modifications. Feedback will notify you whether changes were successful or if there were errors.
If errors are found, exclamation marks will appear next to invalid input fields. Hover over them (or tap on mobile) to view the error details.
The UI dynamically updates based on the number of products in the shop. You may click the 'New Shop' button to change the product count and re-open the UpdateShop UI for testing.

Project overview:
'PlayerMovement' handles sideways movement using A/D or ←/→.
'ProductServerFetcher' fetches server data.
'ProductInstantiater' instantiates products and keeps them in memory for future updates.
'ProductData' & 'ProductList' hold product data and act as server data containers.
'ProductDisplay' displays product data (name, price, description).
'ShopUIUpdater' instantiates 'ShopProductCard' panels based off of the amount of them and their data (name, price, description).
'ShopProductCard' handles the panels where you modify product information in the 'Update Shop' panel

Final thoughts:
This project is a simple white-boxing prototype built in under a day due to balancing reserve service duties in the army. While the project is basic, I hope it demonstrates my 
capabilities and meets the expected standards. Although there wasn't much room to showcase advanced software design, the project effectively conveys the core concept.
